# Japanese Conjugation Helper
**A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs, adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese**. [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function (Word Lookup). Learn japanese with this amazing tool :)

**Download the program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases).** The interval that I release a new version varies from a day to up to a week depending on changes made to the program and how long I've been working on the program.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).

**If you want to give feedback or request features or report bugs, you may do so [here](https://forms.gle/WNV1s41cWKrjSMhH6).**

## **List of commands:**
* Word Lookup - looks up any word or phrase (main feature)
* /p - conjugation practice (practice conjugating a word of your choice into different forms)
* /r - reading practice (essentially a flash card creator)
* /h or /help (brings up more information about a command, not as detailed as the Wiki)

**If you see "‚ç∞" being displayed where Japanese characters are meant to be then follow the steps shown below:**
1. Click the console icon in the very top left of the console window
2. Then click "properties" at the bottom
3. Lastly, make sure you are on the "Font" tab and select the "MS Mincho" font, there are a few other fonts that work too.

## Features planned to be coming soon
* Listening practice - Listen to words and type in what you heard
* Kanji details - when you search for a word using Word Lookup it will bring up information on all the kanji in that word.
* Important Anki decks and generate reverse cards.
* New parameters
* Preferences (settings that will be remembered for the next time you run the program), cool right? No? Ok then :(
