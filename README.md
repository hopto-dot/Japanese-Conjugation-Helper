**A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs, adjectives and nouns. Get kanji infomation, download audio of pronunciations, various tests and practice, a translator & sentence breakdown and more!** [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function (Word Lookup). Learn japanese with this amazing tool :)

**Download the program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases).** The interval that I release a new version will be bigger now because I am back to being a student with lots of other work I need to be focused on, not to fear though, the project isn't dead.

**For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).**
