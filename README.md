# Japanese-Conjugation-Helper
A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs and adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).
