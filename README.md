# Japanese-Conjugation-Helper
A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs, adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese. [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function.

Download the program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases). The interval that I release a new version varies from a day to up to a week depending on changes made to the program and how long I've been working on the program.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).

**If you see "‚ç∞" being displayed where Japanese characters are meant to be then follow the steps shown below:**
1. Click the console icon in the very top left of the console window
2. Then click "properties at the bottom"
3. Lastly, make sure you are on the "Font" tab and select the "MS Mincho" font, there are a few other fonts that work too.

## Features coming soon
* Listening practice - the program will play Japanese audio and you have to type in what is said.
* Kanji details - when you search for a word using Word Lookup it will bring up information on all the kanji in that word.

## Main bugs

* Sometimes when entering a second lot of data with the "/r" with the "2" parameter, it fails to read the data you inputted second.
* Sometimes (but very rarely) the "Kanji-only Reading" will mess up. This should be fixed soon.
* When the list of definitions to pick from is shown (when searching for more than one word) sometimes definitions get mixed up with which one is which. This should be fixed soon.
* The English translation of word forms get messed up, for example "get thinned" when it should be "got thin". This is really hard to 100% fix :(
