# Japanese-Conjugation-Helper
A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs and adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese. [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function.

Download the exe program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases). The interval that I release a new version varies from a day to up to a week depending on changes made to the program and how long I've been working on the program.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).

**If you see "‚ç∞" being displayed where Japanese characters are meant to be then follow the steps shown below:**
1. Click the console icon in the very top left of the console window
2. Then click "properties at the bottom"
3. Lastly, make sure you are on the "Font" tab and select the "MS Mincho" font, there are a few other fonts that work too.

## Current issues

* The "/p" command is broken, this will be fixed in a later release.
* The wiki doesn't contain information on all the commands.
* Sometimes when entering a second lot of data with the "/r" using the "2" parameter, it fails to reading the data you inputted second.
