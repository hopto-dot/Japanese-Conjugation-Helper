# Japanese Conjugation Helper

### Note: When a new update adds a new conjugation, you should reset your preferences because new conjugations change the format of how settings are stored

**A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs, adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese**. [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function (Word Lookup). Learn japanese with this amazing tool :)

**Download the program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases).** The interval that I release a new version varies from a day to up to a week depending on changes made to the program and how long I've been working on the program.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).

**If you want to give feedback, request features or report bugs, you may do so [here](https://forms.gle/WNV1s41cWKrjSMhH6).**

## **List of commands:**
* Word Lookup - looks up any word or phrase (main feature)
* Translate - Type "!" and then anything to translate it, (works with English and Japanese)
* /k - enter japanese and get tested on kanji in the string you inputted
* /p - conjugation practice (practice conjugating a word of your choice into different forms)
* /r - reading practice (essentially a flash card creator)
* /prefs - Lets you change program settings, these are saved for the next time you use the program.
* /h or /help (brings up more information about a command, not as detailed as the Wiki)
