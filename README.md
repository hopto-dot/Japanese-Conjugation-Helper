# Japanese Conjugation Helper

## Note: When a new update adds a new conjugation, you should reset your preferences otherwise the program won't function properly

**A console application that will conjugate Japanese verbs, adjectives and nouns. The program can create example sentences for pretty much any word you throw at it. It has a few other handy features for learning Japanese**. [Here](https://imgur.com/DlKXeyl) you can see the program performing its main function (Word Lookup). Learn japanese with this amazing tool :)

**Download the program [here](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/releases).** The interval that I release a new version varies from a day to up to a week depending on changes made to the program and how long I've been working on the program.

For the main functionality of bringing up conjugations of a word, simple type the word on it's own (in Japanese, Romaji or the English word). Find out more about how this and other commands work in [the Wiki](https://github.com/hopto-dot/Japanese-Conjugation-Helper/wiki/How-to-use).

**If you want to give feedback, request features or report bugs, you may do so [here](https://forms.gle/WNV1s41cWKrjSMhH6).**

## **List of commands:**
* Word Lookup - looks up any word or phrase (main feature)
* Translate - Type "!" and then anything to translate it, (works with English and Japanese)
* /p - conjugation practice (practice conjugating a word of your choice into different forms)
* /r - reading practice (essentially a flash card creator)
* /prefs - Lets you change program settings, these are saved for the next time you use the program.
* /h or /help (brings up more information about a command, not as detailed as the Wiki)

1. Click the console icon in the very top left of the console window
2. Then click "properties" at the bottom
3. Lastly, make sure you are on the "Font" tab and select the "MS Mincho" font, there are a few other fonts that work too.

## Features that might come soon
* Important Anki decks and generate reverse cards
* New parameters
* Search for grammar
* Input sentences and then get definitions for each word
* Listen to/watch a clip from a random movie that contains the word you search
* I am contemplating making a version of this program that has a User Interface, but this probably won't happen as I've never done that before
